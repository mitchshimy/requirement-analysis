## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. It involves understanding what the users need from the software, ensuring the system will meet those needs, and identifying the constraints that may affect the solution. 

**Importance of Requirement Analysis**:
- **Clarifies Project Scope**: Requirement analysis helps define the boundaries of a project, reducing scope creep and ensuring that development efforts align with business goals.
- **Improves Communication**: By gathering input from stakeholders and team members, requirement analysis ensures that everyone involved has a shared understanding of the project.
- **Reduces Risks**: Proper analysis helps identify potential issues early on, reducing the likelihood of costly mistakes during development and after deployment.
- **Improves Quality**: With well-defined requirements, developers can build software that meets user expectations, improving overall quality and customer satisfaction.
- **Supports Validation**: Requirement analysis provides a foundation for validating the software against the initial needs, ensuring the final product is fit for purpose.
